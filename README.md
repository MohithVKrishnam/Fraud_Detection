# Fraud-Transaction-Detection-System_Final_Submission

💳🚨 Fraud Transaction Detection using Machine Learning  
This project focuses on proactively identifying fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning techniques.  
The system analyzes large-scale transaction data to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activities, helping financial institutions reduce losses and improve transaction security.

🚀 Features  
- Handles highly imbalanced real-world transaction data  
- Implements end-to-end data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Uses advanced machine learning models for fraud classification  
- Evaluates performance using business-critical metrics  
- Includes drift monitoring and prevention strategy design  

📁 Dataset  
The dataset consists of approximately **6.3 million financial transactions** with transactional and balance-related features.  
It represents real-world payment behavior and is used for training, validation, and evaluation of the fraud detection model.

🧠 Methodology  
- Data cleaning and outlier analysis  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand fraud patterns  
- Feature selection based on transaction behavior  
- Model development using ensemble learning techniques  
- Model calibration and performance evaluation  

🛠 Technologies Used  
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- XGBoost  
- Matplotlib  

📊 Evaluation Metrics  
- Precision–Recall Curve  
- ROC-AUC  
- Calibration Curve  
- Population Stability Index (PSI) for drift detection  

🛡 Prevention Strategy  
The solution supports real-time fraud scoring, risk-based transaction blocking, human-in-the-loop review, and continuous monitoring to ensure long-term effectiveness.

📈 Results  
The model successfully identifies high-risk fraudulent transactions with strong recall while maintaining controlled false positives, making it suitable for real-world financial fraud detection systems.
